    "Question 2: k th largest factor of N\n",
    "Problem Description:\n",
    "A positive integer d is said to be a factor of another positive integer N if when N is divided by d, the remainder obtained is zero. For example, for number 12, there are 6 factors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12. Every positive integer k has at least two factors, 1 and the number k itself. Given two positive integers N and k, write a program to print the kth largest factor of N.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Format: The input is a comma-separated list of positive integer pairs (N, k).\n",
    "\n",
    "Output Format: The kth highest factor of N. If N does not have k factors, the output should be 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "1<N<10000000000\n",
    "1<k<600.\n",
    "You can assume that N will have no prime factors which are larger than 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: 12,3\n",
    "Output: 4\n",
    "Explanation: N is 12, k is 3. The factors of 12 are (1,2,3,4,6,12). The highest factor is 12 and the third largest factor is 4. The output must be 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: 30,9\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: N is 30, k is 9. The factors of 30 are (1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30). There are only 8 factors. As k is more than the number of factors, the output is 1."
